Give children loratadine liquid instead of tablets if they are under 6 or weigh 30kg or less.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"c1vqa\">How to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"8ejfs\">Loratadine comes as 2 different types of tablet: ordinary and melt-in-the-mouth tablets.</p><p data-block-key=\"4gm25\">Swallow ordinary loratadine tablets with a drink of water, milk or juice. If the tablet has a score line across the middle, you can break it in half if you find it hard to swallow it whole. Do not chew it.</p><p data-block-key=\"lcgvz\">Melt-in-the-mouth tablets dissolve instantly on your tongue without needing a drink. Be careful not to crush them when you take them out of the packet.</p><p data-block-key=\"apg1b\">You can take loratadine with or without food.</p><p data-block-key=\"kcnk9\">Loratadine liquid may be easier for children to take than tablets. The medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"7bpg7\">When to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"nuvch\">You may only need to take loratadine on a day when you have symptoms, for instance if you&#x27;ve been exposed to a trigger such as animal hair. Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as hay fever during spring and summer.</p><p data-block-key=\"6mqg7\">Try to take loratadine at about the same time every day. Choose a time that is easy to remember.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"hi9py\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"mow5r\">If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"a1kqj\">Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"qw6oi\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"dys0j\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"ouc3g\">Loratadine is generally very safe.

Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches usually go away after the first week of taking sotalol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.</li><li data-block-key=\"0xqou\"><b>feeling tired, dizzy or weak</b> \\u2013 if sotalol makes you feel dizzy or weak, stop what you&#x27;re doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery if you&#x27;re feeling tired. Do not drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse.</li><li data-block-key=\"hwdgg\"><b>cold hands or feet</b> \\u2013 put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine in, as these can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. Smoking also makes your skin colder. Try wearing mittens (they&#x27;re warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Do not wear tight watches or bracelets.</li><li data-block-key=\"zr22x\"><b>diarrhoea, feeling or being sick</b> \\u2013 stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your sotalol after you&#x27;ve eaten. Drink plenty of water or other fluids. If you&#x27;re being sick, try small frequent sips to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of <a id=\"20229\" linktype=\"page\">dehydration</a>, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat <a id=\"23184\" linktype=\"page\">diarrhoea or vomiting</a> without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor. If you take the <a id=\"29038\" linktype=\"page\">combined contraceptive pill</a> or <a id=\"29030\" linktype=\"page\">progestogen-only pill</a>, and you&#x27;re being sick (vomiting) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.</li><li data-block-key=\"22heo\"><b>stomach pain</b> \\u2013 try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your tummy may also help. If you are in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</li></ul>",

These release the valproic acid into your body as soon as they pass through your stomach.</p><p data-block-key=\"zdxar\">Swallow the tablets or capsules whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.</p><p data-block-key=\"hxeop\">You can take valproic acid with or without food, but it&#x27;s best to do the same each time.</p><p data-block-key=\"65m6y\">If you&#x27;re taking valproic acid twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).</p><p data-block-key=\"1xm4l\">If you take it 3 to 4 times a day, try to space your doses evenly throughout the day. If you need to take 3 doses, for example, you could take a dose first thing in the morning, early afternoon and bedtime.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"gipsj\">Will my dose go up or down?</h3><p data-block-key=\"74nys\">To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of valproic acid. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.</p><p data-block-key=\"zv55k\">Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may interfere with valproic acid.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"wwrkp\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"kqz3w\">If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s less than 2 hours to your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next one at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"ohzzm\">Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"5nm5l\">If you have epilepsy, it&#x27;s important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.</p><p data-block-key=\"n3mmk\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"g8c28\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"i944b\">Taking too much valproic acid can lead to symptoms such as:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"11aoq\">feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)</li><li data-block-key=\"g5ca0\">headaches, or feeling dizzy</li><li data-block-key=\"iosiw\">muscle weakness</li><li data-block-key=\"vw7yt\">breathing problems</li><li data-block-key=\"567g9\">feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour</li><li data-block-key=\"tenrf\">passing out</li></ul>",

Do not take any other medicines to treat <a id=\"23184\" linktype=\"page\">diarrhoea</a> without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.

If this does not help, or you have <a id=\"19334\" linktype=\"page\">mouth ulcers</a>, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.

These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.</li><li data-block-key=\"rsd2r\"><b>feeling tired or sleepy</b> \\u2013 as your body gets used to valproic acid, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.</li><li data-block-key=\"v9q9m\"><b>headaches</b> \\u2013 make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.</li><li data-block-key=\"sezx9\"><b>weight gain</b> \\u2013 if you find you&#x27;re putting on weight after taking valproic acid, try to <a id=\"26773\" linktype=\"page\">have a healthy balanced diet</a>. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you&#x27;re taking this medicine.

If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.</p><p data-block-key=\"e2k82\">You&#x27;ll usually take the liquid twice a day.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"4fsvc\">When to take sodium valproate</h3><p data-block-key=\"9x3zs\">If you&#x27;re taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.</p><p data-block-key=\"pi5ek\">If you&#x27;re taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).</p><h3 data-block-key=\"nynm0\">Will my dose go up or down?</h3><p data-block-key=\"a3pjw\">To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.</p><p data-block-key=\"mjbd4\">Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"e3on5\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"k30g2\">If you&#x27;ve missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.</p><p data-block-key=\"6swjn\">If you take sodium valproate:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"7piqo\"><b>once a day</b> \\u2013 take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it&#x27;s within a few hours of the next dose.

Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"rv0do\">If you have epilepsy, it&#x27;s important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.</p><p data-block-key=\"4z3ud\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"mspxt\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"x4ee7\">Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"mqtl6\">feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)</li><li data-block-key=\"9sw3g\">headaches or feeling dizzy</li><li data-block-key=\"whx38\">muscle weakness</li><li data-block-key=\"j3wt8\">breathing problems</li><li data-block-key=\"ikjvg\">feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour</li><li data-block-key=\"9joye\">passing out</li></ul>",

If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"c8n9j\">If you forget to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"0ucn6\">If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"3kob5\">Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"5cawu\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"4cqmw\">If you take too much</h3><p data-block-key=\"pv713\">An overdose of propranolol can be very serious. It can significantly slow your heart rate, cause dizziness, trembling and seizures or fits, and make it difficult to breathe.</p><p data-block-key=\"lsz0k\">The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p>",

The usual dose in adults and children aged 12 and over is 1 capsule 3 times a day.</p><p data-block-key=\"6vcjq\">When it&#x27;s mixed with a decongestant, each capsule contains 8mg of acrivastine and 60mg of pseudoephedrine. The usual dose in adults and children aged 12 and over is 1 capsule 3 times a day.</p><p data-block-key=\"cyjhd\">Do not take more than 3 acrivastine capsules, or 3 acrivastine mixed with pseudoephedrine capsules, in 24 hours.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"pg2bs\">How to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"7ub19\">Acrivastine does not usually upset your stomach. You can take it with or without food.</p><p data-block-key=\"87dih\">Swallow the capsules whole. Do not chew them.</p><p data-block-key=\"scrcc\">Always take acrivastine capsules with a drink of water, milk or juice (but do not drink grapefruit juice with acrivastine as you may be more likely to get side effects).</p><h3 data-block-key=\"6isga\">When to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"yneat\">You may only need to take acrivastine on a day you have symptoms, such as when you&#x27;ve been near to something you&#x27;re allergic to, like animal hair.</p><p data-block-key=\"posc3\">Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as to stop hay fever during spring and summer.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"9dpkv\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"l6rq3\">Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"jttl6\">Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than 3 capsules in 24 hours.</p><p data-block-key=\"h3fdl\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"t5bic\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"6qsxp\">Acrivastine is generally very safe. Taking more than your prescribed dose is unlikely to harm you. If you take an extra dose, you might get some of the common side effects.</p><p data-block-key=\"yiomb\">If this happens or you&#x27;re concerned, contact your doctor.</p>",

If it is from a pharmacy or shop, follow the instructions that come with the packet.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"m459\">Dosage and strength</h3><p data-block-key=\"f49vc\">Cetirizine comes as tablets and capsules (10mg) and as a liquid medicine (labelled either 5mg/5ml or 1mg/1ml).</p><p data-block-key=\"2a9q7\">The usual dose for adults is 10mg once a day.</p><p data-block-key=\"3vp26\">Doses are usually lower for people with kidney problems.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"cfuc2\">Children</h4><ul><li data-block-key=\"6dlk9\">For children between 6 to 11 years of age, the usual dose is 5mg, twice a day. Try to leave 10 to 12 hours between doses. So, one first thing in the morning, and one before bedtime.</li><li data-block-key=\"9st4s\">For children between 2 to 5 years of age, the dose is 2.5mg, twice a day.</li><li data-block-key=\"bb4e0\">For children between 1 to 2 years of age, your doctor will use their weight or age to work out the right dose.</li></ul><h3 data-block-key=\"60sh6\">How to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"87kfq\">You can take cetirizine with or without food, but always take the tablets or capsules with a drink of water, milk or squash. Swallow them whole. Do not chew them.</p><p data-block-key=\"a2bdk\">Cetirizine liquid may be easier for children to take than tablets. The liquid medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to give the right dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure out the right amount.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"fh48o\">When to take it</h3><p data-block-key=\"99n99\">You may only need to take cetirizine on a day you have symptoms \\u2013 for example, if you have been in contact with something that has triggered your allergy, like animal hair.</p><p data-block-key=\"9g6hp\">Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms \\u2013 for example, to stop hay fever during spring and summer.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"210dm\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"frok6\">Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"dulfs\">Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"bu2pb\">If you forget to give a dose to a child who is taking cetirizine twice a day, you can give the missed dose if it&#x27;s within 4 hours of when they should have had it.</p><p data-block-key=\"dndo7\">If you remember more than 4 hours after, do not give the missed dose. Instead, wait until the next dose and carry on as normal.</p><p data-block-key=\"7qtr7\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"54edj\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"cev40\">Cetirizine is generally very safe. Taking more than the usual dose is unlikely to harm you or your child.</p><p data-block-key=\"8lah0\">If you take an extra dose, you might get some of the common side effects. If this happens or you&#x27;re concerned, contact your doctor.</p>",

If you take pregabalin for epilepsy, it is particularly important that this is well treated during pregnancy, as seizures can harm you and your baby.</p><p data-block-key=\"ndjb\">It&#x27;s recommended to use effective contraception while taking pregabalin. If you plan to get pregnant, talk to your doctor first, as they may want to review your treatment.</p><p data-block-key=\"bou13\">If you&#x27;re trying to get pregnant or have become pregnant while taking pregabalin, it is recommended to take high dose <a id=\"27448\" linktype=\"page\">folic acid</a> (5mg a day). You can get this from your doctor or midwife.</p><p data-block-key=\"17k2m\">Ideally, you&#x27;ll take high dose folic acid for 3 months before you start trying to get pregnant and for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Do not worry if you have not taken it before you get pregnant, but start taking it as soon as possible once you know that you are pregnant. It helps your baby to grow normally.</p><p data-block-key=\"xbuki\">If you take pregabalin around the time of giving birth, your baby may need extra monitoring for a few days after they&#x27;re born. This is because they may have pregabalin withdrawal symptoms.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"941ci\">Pregabalin and breastfeeding</h3><p data-block-key=\"xd5pk\">If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take pregabalin while breastfeeding. It&#x27;s important to keep taking pregabalin to keep you well.</p><p data-block-key=\"70o04\">Pregabalin passes into breast milk in small amounts, and it&#x27;s unlikely to cause side effects in your baby.</p><p data-block-key=\"cstgl\">If you&#x27;re breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist, as other medicines we know more about might be better while you&#x27;re breastfeeding, but they will help you decide.</p><p data-block-key=\"9dki8\">If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.</p>",

Try to avoid alcohol as it&#x27;ll make you feel worse.</li><li data-block-key=\"pfpgv\"><b>headaches</b> \\u2013 make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Do not drink too much alcohol. Headaches usually go away after the first week of taking carvedilol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last more than a week or are severe.</li><li data-block-key=\"tnemu\"><b>feeling tired</b> \\u2013 do not drive, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery if you\\u2019re feeling tired. Do not drink any alcohol as this will make you feel more tired.</li><li data-block-key=\"8570x\"><b>feeling sick or being sick</b> \\u2013 stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your carvedilol after a meal or snack. If you&#x27;re being sick, try drinking small, frequent sips of water to avoid dehydration.</li><li data-block-key=\"7nk2p\"><b>cold fingers or toes</b> \\u2013 put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them, and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine, as this can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. It\\u2019s best not to wear tight watches or bracelets as well. Try wearing mittens (they&#x27;re warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Speak to your doctor if this side effect bothers you.</li></ul>",

You&#x27;ll usually be prescribed another thyroid medicine called propylthiouracil (PTU). This is because there&#x27;s a small chance that carbimazole can cause problems for your baby&#x27;s development in the first few months of pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key=\"kmti9\">However, it&#x27;s important to keep treating an overactive thyroid. If your thyroid hormone levels are too high, this can also cause problems for your baby.</p><p data-block-key=\"uq4ct\">If you become pregnant while taking carbimazole, keep taking your medicine and speak to your doctor.</p><p data-block-key=\"k6lkl\">If you have thyroid problems, then you will be asked to go to an antenatal clinic to see a pregnancy specialist (obstetrician) and a hormone specialist (endocrinologist). They can advise you on the best treatment options for you and your baby.</p><p data-block-key=\"d53p6\">If you are taking carbimazole and thyroxine together (a &quot;block and replace&quot; regime), this will need to be changed, so it&#x27;s important that you see a specialist early on in your pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key=\"9c1gc\">When taking carbimazole in pregnancy, you&#x27;ll need regular blood tests to check you\\u2019re on the right dose. You may also have extra scans to check the health of your growing baby.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"dpneo\">Carbimazole and breastfeeding</h3><p data-block-key=\"iaynj\">It&#x27;s usually OK to take carbimazole while you are breastfeeding. Carbimazole passes into breast milk but only in small amounts. This is probably too little to affect your baby.</p><p data-block-key=\"dsjk9\">After a while, your doctor may take a blood test for the baby to check the levels of their thyroid hormones.</p><p data-block-key=\"d2skj\">If you have any concerns about your baby&#x27;s health, talk to your midwife, health visitor or doctor straight away.</p>",

It\\u2019s best to do this in the evening as bimatoprost works better then.</p><p data-block-key=\"mqv69\">It comes as a bottle or a box of single-use droppers. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"buowf\">How to use eye drops</h3><p data-block-key=\"tk9m8\">If you wear contact lenses, make sure you remove them before using your eye drops. Wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in.</p><p data-block-key=\"u7f2v\">The drops may make your vision blurred if you use them with contact lenses.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"8382g\">Wash your hands.</li><li data-block-key=\"v089y\">If you are using a bottle, remove the cap. If it does not come with a separate dropper, practise gently squeezing the bottle away from your eye first, to get used to the pressure and the time it takes for 1 drop to fall out. If you are using the single-use dropper, twist off the tip.</li><li data-block-key=\"icidt\">Make sure the dropper or tip of the bottle does not touch your eye, eyelashes, eyelid, your skin, or any other surface.</li><li data-block-key=\"ov0zd\">Use your finger to gently pull down the lower eyelid and tilt your head back.</li><li data-block-key=\"ujmfn\">Hold the dropper or tip of the bottle over your eye, look up, squeeze gently and allow 1 drop to fall into your lower eyelid.</li><li data-block-key=\"5o5sq\">Close your eye. Gently press your finger over the inside corner of your eye (over the eyelid) for about a minute. This helps to keep the drops in the eye.</li><li data-block-key=\"mj92d\">Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.</li><li data-block-key=\"ebdef\">Repeat in your other eye if your doctor has told you to do this. There\\u2019s enough liquid in 1 single-dose dropper to put a drop in both eyes if needed.</li><li data-block-key=\"iky1d\">Put the cap back on the bottle. If you are using the single-dose dropper, throw it away.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"m7rgs\">If you use bimatoprost with other eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes before using your other eye drops. The second eye drops can wash out the bimatoprost, so it may not work as well.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"19f11\">Expiry dates</h3><p data-block-key=\"ljmbo\">Use the bimatoprost eye drops within the expiry date on the bottle and within 4 weeks of opening. This will help to prevent the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working so well.</p><p data-block-key=\"3ezjh\">The single-dose droppers come in a silver foil pouch. Once you open the pouch, use the droppers within 30 days. Do not use the droppers after the expiry date.</p><p data-block-key=\"s7guh\">You could write the date you opened the bottle or packet on the label or the box. This will help you know when you need to start using a new one.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"y50s8\">What if I forget to use it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"1i6xc\">If you forget a dose by less than 2 hours, use a single drop as soon as you remember, then return to your normal routine for your next dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"f8h6q\">If you forget a dose by more than 2 hours, skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the normal time.</p><p data-block-key=\"helx8\">Never use 2 doses at the same time. Never use an extra dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"jnzyr\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"16o1g\">What if I use too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"xsz4z\">Using too many drops can irritate your eye and make it water and turn red. If you get too much bimatoprost in your eye, rinse it all out with water. Do not put any more drops in until it is time for your next dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"b9lzr\">Any irritation, watering or redness should get better, but if you are worried about it ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</p><p data-block-key=\"ippm8\">Contact your doctor if you swallow bimatoprost accidentally and feel unwell.</p>",

Instructions can vary between different manufacturers, as some bottles look different and work differently. You may find using a mirror helps.</p><p data-block-key=\"oyajw\">If you wear contact lenses, make sure you remove them before using your eye drops. Wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in.</p><p data-block-key=\"fwybl\">The drops may make your vision blurred, cause irritation and may change the colour of the contact lenses.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"yw60x\">Wash your hands.</li><li data-block-key=\"yvkc9\">Shake the bottle and twist off the cap. If it does not come with a separate dropper and you have not used these eye drops before, practise gently squeezing the bottle away from your eye first, to get used to the pressure and the time it takes for 1 drop to fall out.</li><li data-block-key=\"o6tbz\">Make sure the tip of the bottle does not touch your eye, eyelashes, eyelid, your skin, or any other surface.</li><li data-block-key=\"22ihp\">Tilt your head back. Use your finger to gently pull down your lower eyelid.</li><li data-block-key=\"p6t0s\">Hold the dropper over your eye, look up, squeeze gently and allow 1 drop to fall into your lower eyelid. If the drop misses your eye, try again.</li><li data-block-key=\"nnhzt\">Close your eye. Gently press your finger over the inside corner of your eye (over the eyelid) for about a minute. This helps to keep the drop in the eye.</li><li data-block-key=\"r44b3\">Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.</li><li data-block-key=\"8y5ei\">Repeat in your other eye if your doctor has told you to do this.</li><li data-block-key=\"tj92e\">Put the cap back on the bottle as soon as you&#x27;ve finished using it.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"ep4qr\">If you find it hard to use eye drops, ask a pharmacist for advice. They may be able to recommend an eye drop dispenser.</p><p data-block-key=\"4t50v\">If you use brinzolamide with other eye drops or eye ointment, wait at least 5 minutes before using them. They can wash out the brinzolamide and it may not work as well. It&#x27;s best to use eye ointments last.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"3j3ng\">Expiry dates</h3><p data-block-key=\"x3fiz\">Use the brinzolamide eye drops within the expiry date on the bottle and within 4 weeks of opening. This will help to prevent the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working so well.</p><p data-block-key=\"mxvfl\">You could write the date you opened the bottle or packet on the label or the box. This will help you to know when you need to start using a new one.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"0p7q4\">What if I forget to use it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"sppmj\">If you forget a dose by less than 2 hours, use the eye drops as soon as you remember, then return to your normal routine for your next dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"cfufk\">If you forget a dose by more than 2 hours, skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the normal time.</p><p data-block-key=\"11too\">Never use 2 doses at the same time. Never use an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"gwu03\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"54pai\">What if I use too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"r7rg4\">Using too many drops can irritate your eye and make it water and turn red. If you get too much brinzolamide in your eye, rinse it all out with water. Do not put any more drops in until it is time for your next dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"vg25y\">Any irritation, watering or redness should get better, but if you are worried about it ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</p><p data-block-key=\"pbdn7\">Contact your doctor if you swallow brinzolamide.</p>",

It also might stop medicine that you put under your tongue from dissolving properly, such as medicine for <a id=\"19607\" linktype=\"page\">angina</a>.</li><li data-block-key=\"env4\"><b>headache</b> \\u2013 make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headache is severe or lasts longer than 1 or 2 days.</li><li data-block-key=\"44bgd\"><b>feeling dizzy, sleepy or a spinning sensation</b> \\u2013 do not drive, cycle, use tools, or operate machinery. Avoid drinking alcohol, as this may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your doctor if the dizziness or sleepiness bothers you.</li><li data-block-key=\"cjdhd\"><b>diarrhoea or being sick</b> \\u2013 drink lots of water or squash, to avoid <a id=\"20229\" linktype=\"page\">dehydration</a>. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor, if the effects last more than 1 or 2 days.</li><li data-block-key=\"4fasn\"><b>constipation</b> \\u2013 <a id=\"27046\" linktype=\"page\">eat more high-fibre foods</a>, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to <a id=\"26740\" linktype=\"page\">exercise</a> more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to a pharmacist or doctor. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgpAQ-cirU\">Watch this short video about how to treat constipation</a>.</li><li data-block-key=\"djf2m\"><b>farting and burping</b> \\u2013 eat less foods that cause wind, like lentils, peas, beans and onions.

Ask your pharmacist about remedies you can buy to help with trapped wind.</li><li data-block-key=\"28ukv\"><b>stomach pain</b> \\u2013 try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Try putting a heat pad or a covered hot water bottle on your stomach to help.

It also might stop medicine that you put under your tongue from dissolving properly, such as medicine for <a id=\"19607\" linktype=\"page\">angina</a>.</li><li data-block-key=\"ab31e\"><b>headache</b> \\u2013 make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headache is severe or lasts longer than 1 or 2 days.</li><li data-block-key=\"cold\"><b>feeling dizzy, sleepy or a spinning sensation</b> \\u2013 do not drive, cycle, use tools, or operate machinery. Avoid drinking alcohol, as this may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your doctor if the dizziness or sleepiness bothers you.</li><li data-block-key=\"a18n4\"><b>diarrhoea or being sick</b> \\u2013 drink lots of water or squash, to avoid <a id=\"20229\" linktype=\"page\">dehydration</a>. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having strong-smelling pee.    If you take the <a id=\"29038\" linktype=\"page\">combined contraceptive pill </a>or <a id=\"29030\" linktype=\"page\">progestogen-only pill</a> and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, or it makes you sick (vomit), your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice. Do not take any other medicines without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor, if the effects last more than 1 or 2 days.</li><li data-block-key=\"2nru7\"><b>constipation</b> \\u2013 <a id=\"27046\" linktype=\"page\">get more fibre into your diet</a>, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to <a id=\"26740\" linktype=\"page\">exercise</a> more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to a pharmacist or doctor. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgpAQ-cirU\">Watch this short video about how to treat constipation</a>.</li><li data-block-key=\"40a6p\"><b>farting and burping</b> \\u2013 eat less foods that cause wind, like lentils, peas, beans and onions. It might also help to eat smaller and more frequent meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. Ask your pharmacist about remedies you can buy to help with trapped wind.</li><li data-block-key=\"cce8d\"><b>stomach pain</b> \\u2013 try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Try putting a heat pad or a covered hot water bottle on your stomach to help. If you are in a lot of sudden severe pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</li><li data-block-key=\"ad7ui\"><b>dry eyes</b> \\u2013 ask your pharmacist or optician to recommend some eye drops.

If you&#x27;re not sure, ask a pharmacist or your doctor.</p><p data-block-key=\"kmfc\">Verapamil comes as standard tablets, slow-release (long-acting) tablets, and a liquid (oral solution).</p><p data-block-key=\"5mo30\">Slow-release tablets release the medicine gradually into your body. This means you do not need to take them as often.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"23kmu\">Dosage</h3><p data-block-key=\"pkpu\">The dose of verapamil depends on why you&#x27;re taking it.</p><p data-block-key=\"bdjjl\">If you have liver disease, your doctor may prescribe you a low dose and will monitor you more closely.</p><p data-block-key=\"b6sao\">If a doctor has prescribed verapamil for your child, the dose will usually be lower than adults. It will depend on how old your child is. Children will usually be given standard tablets or liquid.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"fr7s\">Dosage for high blood pressure</h4><p data-block-key=\"em17a\">Standard tablets or liquid \\u2013 you&#x27;ll usually start on a dose of 120mg, taken twice a day. Your doctor may increase your dose to a maximum of 480mg a day, split into divided doses.</p><p data-block-key=\"mgc7\">Slow-release tablets \\u2013 you&#x27;ll usually start on a dose of 240mg, taken once a day. Your doctor may increase it to 480mg a day. If your dose is higher than 240mg daily, it can be split into 2 doses and taken morning and evening.</p><p data-block-key=\"dqtaa\">Liquid verapamil contains 40mg in each 5ml spoonful.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"345sp\">Dosage for angina</h4><p data-block-key=\"beahs\">Standard tablets or liquid \\u2013 the usual dose is 80mg or 120mg, taken 3 times a day, although some people may find that taking verapamil twice a day is enough to control their symptoms.</p><p data-block-key=\"232nl\">Long-acting tablets \\u2013 the usual dose is 240mg, taken twice a day. Your doctor might reduce this dose to 240mg, taken once a day.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"bfdpu\">Dosage for irregular heart rhythm</h4><p data-block-key=\"2hdh\">Standard tablets or liquid \\u2013 the usual dose is between 40mg and 120mg, taken 3 times a day.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"8lsq9\">Dosage after a heart attack</h4><p data-block-key=\"1kdu1\">Slow-release tablets \\u2013 the usual dose is 360mg a day, split into 2 or 3 doses throughout the day. This can be taken as 240mg in the morning and 120mg in the evening, or as 120mg taken 3 times a day.</p><p data-block-key=\"efm2i\">You&#x27;ll usually wait at least 1 week after a heart attack before starting verapamil.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"47n8l\">Will my dose go up or down?</h4><p data-block-key=\"8j4br\">If the dose you start on does not work well enough (your blood pressure does not lower enough, or your angina is not controlled), then your doctor will gradually increase your dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"av6h7\">Your doctor may also lower your dose if your blood pressure is controlled or the side effects bother you.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"5fq2v\">How to take verapamil</h3><p data-block-key=\"ces1i\">Swallow your tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not chew or crush them, as it&#x27;s important that they go into your stomach before they dissolve.</p><p data-block-key=\"2o3dp\">You can take verapamil at any time of day. It may help you to remember if it&#x27;s the same time each day.</p><p data-block-key=\"6pqif\">If you&#x27;re taking verapamil as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you take the right amount. If you do not get one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give you the right amount.</p><p data-block-key=\"9asnl\">You can take verapamil with or without food.</p><p data-block-key=\"2do8p\">It&#x27;s important not to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you&#x27;re taking this medicine. Grapefruit can increase the amount of verapamil in your body and make side effects worse.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"5dk6v\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"63c6e\">If you forget to take your medicine, take it as soon as you remember unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, leave out the missed dose and take the next one at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"el4mp\">Do not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"b8vh6\">If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"6hbik\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"fd8ju\">Taking too much verapamil can cause your blood pressure to go too low. It can also make you feel faint, dizzy or sleepy because it can cause your heart to beat irregularly.</p>",

You can take tablets with or without food.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"6hb9f\">How to take slow-release tablets</h3><p data-block-key=\"f4ags\">Slow-release tablets release oxybutynin slowly and evenly throughout the day.</p><p data-block-key=\"6lvbd\">Swallow these tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not break, crush or chew them.</p><p data-block-key=\"1ql06\">Try to take your tablet at the same time each day. This will help you to remember to take them.</p><p data-block-key=\"8hg45\">Part of the tablet can pass through your body and you might see it in your poo. Do not worry, this is normal and does not affect the way the medicine works.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"3k1ab\">How to take liquid</h3><p data-block-key=\"53pq\">If you are giving this medicine to a child to help stop them wetting the bed, give the last dose just before bedtime.</p><p data-block-key=\"69erk\">Oxybutynin liquid will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount of medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"a2cjd\">How to use patches</h3><p data-block-key=\"1i53\">Oxybutynin patches are applied twice a week.</p><p data-block-key=\"1k77h\">They work like a plaster., you stick them to your skin.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"93f7p\">Follow the instructions that come with the patches.</li><li data-block-key=\"9k14\">Stick a patch to clean, dry skin on your stomach, hip or bottom twice a week (every 3 or 4 days).</li><li data-block-key=\"2gogu\">Change the patch on the same 2 days every week, such as every Sunday and Wednesday, or Monday and Thursday.</li><li data-block-key=\"ec530\">Remove the old patch before sticking on the new one.</li><li data-block-key=\"7i655\">Stick the new patch to a different area of your stomach, hips or bottom. Using the same area may irritate your skin. Do not stick the patch in the same place for at least 1 week.</li></ol><h3 data-block-key=\"e21ni\">Will my dose go up or down?</h3><p data-block-key=\"84a58\">Your doctor may increase your dose depending on how the medicine works for you.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"39ipa\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"20qhn\">If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s almost time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"4uo48\">Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p data-block-key=\"b0f5b\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"803d1\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"6lb9p\">Taking 1 extra dose of oxybutynin is unlikely to harm you.</p><p data-block-key=\"1oai3\">However, you may get more side effects, such as a dry mouth or headache.</p><p data-block-key=\"8s441\">The amount of oxybutynin that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person, and too much oxybutynin can be dangerous.</p>",

If you\\u2019re using the single-dose dropper, twist the top off.</li><li data-block-key=\"6n909\">Make sure the tip of the bottle or dropper does not touch anything, including your eye, eyelashes, eyelid or your skin.</li><li data-block-key=\"1lqfs\">Use your finger to gently pull down your lower eyelid and tilt your head back.</li><li data-block-key=\"5psbc\">Hold the bottle or dropper over your eye, look up, and allow 1 drop to fall into your lower eyelid.</li><li data-block-key=\"84mnv\">Close your eye. Gently press your finger over the inside corner of your eye (over the eyelid) for about 1 minute. This helps to keep the drop in your eye.</li><li data-block-key=\"7nkt7\">Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.</li><li data-block-key=\"3kac1\">Repeat in your other eye if you need to. There is enough liquid in 1 single-dose dropper to put a drop in both eyes if needed.</li><li data-block-key=\"bg687\">Put the cap back on the bottle. If you are using the single-dose dropper, throw it away.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"2ivij\">If you missed your eye when putting in the drop, you can try again immediately.</p><p data-block-key=\"dfn84\">If you use carmellose sodium with other eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes before using your other eye drops. The second eye drops can wash out the carmellose sodium and it may not work as well.</p><p data-block-key=\"5kc9b\">If you also use an eye ointment, always use your eye drops first and wait 5 minutes before using the ointment.</p><p data-block-key=\"8bfuu\">If you find it hard to use eye drops, ask a pharmacist for advice. They may be able to recommend an eye drop dispenser. Using eye drops correctly can be difficult, but there are several useful devices (compliance aids) available to help. Speak to your pharmacist to see which device would best suit your eye drops. Brands include,Autodrop, Opticare and Drop Aid Single Dose.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"f877q\">Expiry dates and storage</h3><p data-block-key=\"sqfu\">Use the carmellose sodium eye drops within the expiry date on the bottle. Use them within 4 weeks of opening, unless your drops come with different instructions. This will help to prevent the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working so well. Ask a pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p data-block-key=\"b3f50\">Single-dose droppers should usually be used as soon as you open them. But you can reseal some brands and use them again up to 12 hours later, for example Carmize, Cellusan and Melophthal.</p><p data-block-key=\"1b925\">You could write the date or time you opened the bottle or packet on the label or the box. This will help you to remember when you need to start using a new one.</p><p data-block-key=\"a428g\">Carmellose sodium eye drops can be stored at room temperature and do not need to be kept in a fridge.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"a58l6\">What if I forget to use it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"860rr\">If you forget to use your eye drops, use them when you need them next or when it\\u2019s time for your next dose.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"3k79g\">What if I use too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"q8nd\">Using too many eye drops should not cause problems<b>.</b></p>",

                            "value": "<p data-block-key=\"7tuiv\">Co-beneldopa comes as:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"dctgd\">standard capsules</li><li data-block-key=\"eg3fl\">slow-release (or prolonged release) capsules</li><li data-block-key=\"brv25\">tablets that dissolve in a drink (dispersible tablets)</li></ul><p data-block-key=\"abf2t\">You will be prescribed either a slow-release capsule or standard capsule, a dissolvable tablet or a combination of these. Always follow the instructions from your doctor or specialist nurse.</p><p data-block-key=\"bhv35\">The tablets and standard capsules start to work right away. You&#x27;ll usually take these 3 or 4 times a day, depending on your dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"631dj\">Slow-release capsules get the medicine into your body gradually. This helps to reduce the symptoms of your condition over longer periods of time. If your condition causes sleep problems, for instance, taking slow-release co-beneldopa capsules at night can help. This means you may not have to take them as often.</p><p data-block-key=\"5t5qk\">Take your co-beneldopa at the same time each day. This is important to help control your symptoms. Delays can cause symptoms to return.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"eqno0\">Dosage</h3><p data-block-key=\"8mipg\">Doses vary from person to person.</p><p data-block-key=\"ot0j\">Co-beneldopa capsules and tablets come in different strengths. The information on the medicine packet shows the amount of levodopa and the amount of benserazide (both in milligrams) it contains.</p><p data-block-key=\"7bj8l\">You will usually start on a low dose. Your doctor or specialist nurse will increase your dose gradually until your symptoms are under control. It&#x27;s best to take the lowest dose that controls your symptoms. This helps reduce your chance of side effects.</p><p data-block-key=\"1j2ta\">Do not stop taking co-beneldopa suddenly. If you need to stop taking this medicine, your doctor or specialist nurse will reduce your dose gradually. This is to prevent withdrawal symptoms.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"4spjv\">How to take co-beneldopa capsules</h3><p data-block-key=\"34as0\">Swallow the capsules whole, with a drink of water. Do not crush or chew the slow-release capsules. This is because they have a coating that lets the medicine into your system gradually.</p><p data-block-key=\"79kot\">Do not take your medicine with a meal. This is because food reduces the amount of medicine that is absorbed into your body. It&#x27;s best to take your medicine at least 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after eating.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"cj08n\">How to take co-beneldopa tablets that dissolve in a drink</h3><p data-block-key=\"3012b\">Put the tablets in a small glass of water and stir well until the tablets have dissolved. Drink the mixture within 30 minutes.</p><p data-block-key=\"48g3d\">If you do not like the taste, try mixing the tablets with diluted fruit squash instead. However, do not use orange juice.</p><p data-block-key=\"54i3g\">Do not take your medicine with a meal, as taking it with food stops your body absorbing the medicine properly. It&#x27;s best to take your medicine at least 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after eating.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"20fd5\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"1dmse\">If you forget to take your co-beneldopa, leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as usual.</p><p data-block-key=\"f2e4j\">Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"830co\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask a pharmacist for other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"9rlf1\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"et4ro\">Taking 1 extra capsule or tablet as a one-off is unlikely to harm you, but talk to your doctor, specialist nurse or pharmacist if you are concerned.</p>",

The liquid contains 250mg per 5ml.</p><p data-block-key=\"8f099\">Doses will vary. Your dose and how often you take it depends on why you need sulfasalazine and how severe your symptoms are.</p><p data-block-key=\"1m382\">For inflammatory bowel disease the usual dose is either:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"2tko2\">2 to 4 tablets or 20ml to 40ml of liquid, 4 times a day</li><li data-block-key=\"fb1tp\">1 to 2 suppositories, twice a day</li></ul><p data-block-key=\"c1bqi\">For rheumatoid arthritis, when you start treatment you&#x27;ll usually take one 500mg tablet a day. This will increase by 1 tablet a day each week until you reach a dose of 1 tablet 4 times a day, or 2 tablets 3 times a day, depending on how you respond to it.</p><p data-block-key=\"2lmlo\">Children&#x27;s doses are often lower.

Do not break, chew or crush them. This is because some tablets have a special coating to protect the medicine from the acids in your stomach.</p><p data-block-key=\"ec3cv\">You can take sulfasalazine tablets with or without food.</p><p data-block-key=\"u78i\">Try to space the doses evenly throughout the day and night, with a gap of no more than 8 hours between your bedtime and morning dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"di90g\">Drink plenty of fluids when taking this medicine to help prevent possible kidney problems.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"8e1i4\">How to take sulfasalazine liquid</h3><p data-block-key=\"9hcub\">Take the liquid with food. You&#x27;ll usually take the same amount 4 times a day.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"4tv8g\">How to use sulfasalazine suppositories</h3><p data-block-key=\"bo61k\">Sulfasalazine suppositories are used to treat inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p data-block-key=\"1ap3v\">You will generally use the suppositories twice a day, in the morning and at bedtime. Use them after you do a poo.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"45l64\">Wash your hands before and after using the suppository. Also clean around your bottom (anus) with mild soap and water, rinse and pat dry.</li><li data-block-key=\"cpah1\">Unwrap the suppository.</li><li data-block-key=\"a8gg6\">Gently push the suppository into your anus with the pointed end first. It needs to go in about 3 centimetres (1 inch).</li><li data-block-key=\"9sfu9\">Sit or lie still for about 15 minutes. The suppository will melt inside your bottom. This is normal.</li><li data-block-key=\"epfbt\">Try not to empty your bowels for at least an hour after inserting the suppository so it will work better.</li></ol><h3 data-block-key=\"dgioh\">Will my dose go up or down?</h3><p data-block-key=\"b15dp\">Once your symptoms start to get better, your doctor may reduce your dose to a maintenance dose. This is a lower dose of sulfasalazine that helps keep your symptoms under control.</p><p data-block-key=\"fbvmb\">If your symptoms flare up again, your doctor may want to put your dose back up.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"ebjer\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"98td9\">If you miss a dose of sulfasalazine, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next one at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"8pcf9\">Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"a1pef\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"dbm2b\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"9ot65\">Taking too much sulfasalazine is unlikely to cause you any problems.</p><p data-block-key=\"28aq6\">However, speak to your doctor or a pharmacist if you take more than double your usual dose and you feel unwell. They may need to monitor you for side effects.</p>",

                            "value": "<p data-block-key=\"nz6ci\">Always follow the instructions from a pharmacist or doctor, or the leaflet that comes with your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"bf4qv\">Dosage</h3><p data-block-key=\"1mctt\">Your dose will depend on why you need it and on the type and brand of mesalazine that your doctor has prescribed for you. It also depends on whether you are taking it for a short or long time.</p><p data-block-key=\"dqnr0\">For children, the dose may be lower, and it is calculated according to their weight.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"9jkv0\">How to take tablets and granules</h3><p data-block-key=\"bnujg\">You will either take the tablets or granules once a day, or as 2 or 3 smaller doses throughout the day.</p><p data-block-key=\"atso6\">Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not break, chew or crush them. This is because some tablets have a special coating to delay when they start to work, or to protect the medicine from the acids in your stomach.</p><p data-block-key=\"cg9h9\">For granules, open the sachet and tip the granules onto your tongue. Swallow them whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them, as some granules have a special coating.</p><p data-block-key=\"85t7u\">You can take some brands with food. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine.</p><p data-block-key=\"eolfm\">If you&#x27;re also taking indigestion medicines or remedies, leave a 2 hour gap before and after taking mesalazine. Indigestion treatments can affect how well the medicine works.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"e947j\">How to use suppositories</h3><p data-block-key=\"9g3ro\">Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many suppositories to use each day. Some types you use once a day before you go to bed, and others you use several times a day with the last dose before you go to bed. Use them after you do a poo.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"8kllq\">Wash your hands before and after using the suppository. Also clean around your bottom (anus) with mild soap and water, rinse and pat dry.</li><li data-block-key=\"blced\">Unwrap the suppository.</li><li data-block-key=\"7mptk\">Gently push the suppository into your anus with the pointed end first. It needs to go in about 3 centimetres (1 inch).</li><li data-block-key=\"86u9m\">Sit or lie still for about 15 minutes. The suppository will start to soften, as it melts with your body heat. This is normal.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"if1p\">Try not to do a poo for at least an hour after using a suppository. This gives the medicine time to work.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"7gl9v\">How to use enemas</h3><p data-block-key=\"e7p\">You will usually use mesalazine enemas once a day before you go to bed.</p><p data-block-key=\"ac8r5\">Use the enema after doing a poo. This is because the medicine works best when your bowels are empty.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"b1f3j\">Wash your hands before and after using the enema.</li><li data-block-key=\"b6kbd\">Lie on your side, with your bottom slightly higher than the rest of your body. You can use a pillow to lift your bottom up. You may want to lie on a towel.</li><li data-block-key=\"cn98d\">Put one of the disposable plastic bags provided over your hand (like a glove) and pick up the bottle.</li><li data-block-key=\"b62qv\">Shake the bottle.</li><li data-block-key=\"eat8b\">Break the seal on the nozzle, or remove the protective cap.</li><li data-block-key=\"2v2gi\">Gently push the nozzle into your bottom (anus) as far as is comfortable.</li><li data-block-key=\"39rgp\">Squeeze the bottle steadily to allow the liquid to empty into your anus quite quickly. This takes about 30 to 40 seconds. It&#x27;s normal for some liquid to be left in the bottle afterwards.</li><li data-block-key=\"cstv1\">Remove the nozzle from your bottom.</li><li data-block-key=\"758bh\">Peel the disposable plastic bag off your hand and use it to cover the bottle, ready to throw away.</li><li data-block-key=\"ejgc0\">Roll onto your front and wait for 5 minutes. This will stop any liquid coming out of your bottom.</li><li data-block-key=\"ah5bq\">For sleeping, find a comfortable position that keeps the liquid in your bottom for as long as possible. The longer it stays there, the better it will work.</li></ol><h3 data-block-key=\"ftq7o\">How to use rectal foam</h3><p data-block-key=\"60an9\">You will usually use mesalazine rectal foam once a day before you go to bed. The dose is 2 full applicators.</p><p data-block-key=\"cpkqe\">Use the rectal foam after doing a poo. This is because the medicine works best when your bowels are empty.</p><p data-block-key=\"9ulrm\">After you apply the foam, try not to poo again until the next morning. For the medicine to work properly it needs to stay inside your bowel as long as possible.</p><p data-block-key=\"crsne\">First read the instruction leaflet. The pictures show you exactly how to use the foam.</p><p data-block-key=\"51obh\">Before using it for the first time, remove the plastic flap (or safety lock) from underneath the dome-shaped pump at the top of the can.</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"7u76n\">Wash your hands before and after using the foam.</li><li data-block-key=\"fjr4i\">Push a new applicator onto the nozzle. This nozzle sticks out beneath the dome at the top of the can.</li><li data-block-key=\"3nqd5\">Shake the can for about 20 seconds.</li><li data-block-key=\"a3k2u\">There is a rounded gap at the base of the dome. Twist the dome until the gap lines up with the nozzle.</li><li data-block-key=\"5pvso\">Put your finger on top of the dome and turn the can upside down. The spray will only work properly if you hold the can with the dome pointing straight down.</li><li data-block-key=\"d63pu\">Either stand with one leg raised on a chair, or lie down on your side with your lower leg stretched out and upper leg bent.</li><li data-block-key=\"8agsi\">Gently put the tip of the applicator into your anus as far as possible. You may want to use a lubricating jelly on the tip of the applicator.</li><li data-block-key=\"83rpp\">Push the dome down. This fills the applicator with a dose of foam.</li><li data-block-key=\"59plg\">Release the dome very slowly, to push the foam out.</li><li data-block-key=\"5cvrl\">Wait 10 to 15 seconds and then slowly remove the applicator from your bottom. Do this slowly to prevent the foam coming out.</li><li data-block-key=\"3fl4q\">Remove the applicator from the nozzle. Put it in the plastic bag provided and throw the bag away (with your normal household rubbish).</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"9cbb9\">Repeat from step 1 using a new applicator, so that you use 2 full applicators of foam.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"6d7t7\">Will my dose go up or down?</h3><p data-block-key=\"bvgcv\">Once your symptoms start to get better, it&#x27;s likely that your dose will be reduced. This lower dose is sometimes called a maintenance dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"70f5u\">Your doctor may want to increase your dose if your symptoms start to get worse again.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"fir0c\">What if I forget to take it?</h3><p data-block-key=\"3rh8u\">If you miss a dose of mesalazine, take it as soon as you remember, unless it&#x27;s almost time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed one and take the next dose at the usual time.</p><p data-block-key=\"9er3p\">Do not take 2 doses together to make up for a forgotten dose.</p><p data-block-key=\"5ti96\">If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"33c4e\">What if I take too much?</h3><p data-block-key=\"44ose\">Taking too much mesalazine as a one-off is unlikely to cause problems.</p>",
